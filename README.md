  Come Watch

comewatch was a telegram bot written in Node.Js for downloading movies with direct link!

# so why ComeWatch was developed?
with filtering download movie websites we decided to make a telegram bot to download movies/series for free!ðŸ˜Ž

# how it works ?!
manually get direct links with crawling them from available sources and store them in database.(so you have to collect your database first)

user starts bot in telegram and search for movie/series by name,bot starts looking for name in database, and sends back fetched links to user.
after specefic number of downloads user must join channel otherwise,user can't download anymore (you can remove this rule)
